"""Export stage — crop path plus captions plus watermark plus audio
normalisation to an MP4.

The whole render is a single ffmpeg pass. Per-shot crop segments are trimmed out
of the source, cropped independently, scaled to a common output size, and
concatenated in the filtergraph — which is what allows a wide two-shot and a
tight single to sit in one clip without a mid-stream frame-size change. A
watermark, if one is configured, is composited on top of that as a last stage.
