"""In-process job queue.

One video is processed at a time, FIFO. That's a deliberate constraint rather
than a limitation: transcription, face detection, and encoding each want the
whole GPU, and running two jobs concurrently on a 6 GB card makes both slower
than running them in sequence.

The queue is durable because it lives in SQLite — a crash mid-job leaves the row
as ``running``, and startup requeues it so the resumable stages pick up where
they left off.
